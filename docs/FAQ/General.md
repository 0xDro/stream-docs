### Why are there "rounds"?
The vaults are structured around rounds to allow for efficient and secure calculation of share price. This concept also makes the process of withdrawals seamless, as they can happen asynchronously and can be made at any time.

### How long is each round?
Each round lasts exactly one week. The round gets rolled over to the next every Friday.

### How are vault shares represented?
Vault shares are represented through an ERC-20 token. They can be self-custodied or kept in the vault.

### What protocols are deposits being traded on?
dYdX v3, dYdX v4, Hyperliquid, Maker, Aave.
