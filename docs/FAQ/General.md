### Why are there "rounds"?
The vaults are designed in rounds to facilitate accurate and secure share price calculations. This approach ensures smooth withdrawal processes that can occur asynchronously at any time. Apart from managing share pricing and withdrawals, the round system helps vaults optimize capital efficiency and reduce gas expenses.

### How long is each round?
Each round lasts exactly one week. The round gets rolled over to the next every Friday (10PM PST).

### How are vault shares represented?
Vault shares are represented through an ERC-20 token. They can be self-custodied or kept in the vault.

### What protocols are deposits being traded on?
dYdX v3, dYdX v4, Hyperliquid, Maker, Aave.

### Are the Stream Vaults audited?
Yes, we have received one full audit by [deadrosesxyz](https://twitter.com/deadrosesxyz)
